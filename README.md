**Article Name** Google to fund two full-time Linux kernel security developers

Security issues has always been interesting to me. I have considered Linux operating system to be the go to tool for professional developers, ML engineers etc. I am very surprised to see that Linux Foundationâ€™s Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) and Google have focused its efforts on this particular issue. 

However I am most surprised to read that they plan on hiring **only** two full-time Linux kernel security developers. In my mind all the OS development and especially security requires an army of SDs with exceptional knowledge. The fixes described in the article are also interesting to me as I have imagined that security deals with completely different types of issues.

I'm a huge fan of linux but after having tried it and faced compatibility issues, I switched back to mac. However, in my utopian view of the world, I would love it if Linux was the most widely used OS and was compaitible with everything. Google's funding is a step in the right direction but as you noted, only two people is not enough given the scope of the work
